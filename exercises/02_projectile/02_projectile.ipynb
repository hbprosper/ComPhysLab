    "### Gravitational field\n",
    "According to Newton the **magnitude** of the force of gravity between two particles labeled 1 and 2 of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$, respectively, and a distance $r$ apart is given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f_g & = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} ,\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $G = 6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-2}$ is Newton's gravitational constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"grav_force.png\" align=\"left\" alt=\"gravitational force\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "Consider particle 1, of mass $m_1$. The magnitude of the force on particle 1, $f_g$, can be rewritten as\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    f_g & = m_1 g,\\quad\\text{ where } g  = \\frac{G m_2}{r^2} .\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "The above expressions can be interpreted using a truly brilliant idea by the British scientist Michael Faraday (1791-1867), namely, the concept of a <strong>field</strong>. A field is something that exists everywhere in space that can be described by attaching a mathematical entity at every point in space. If the entity is a $scalar$, that is, a number, then we have a <strong>scalar field</strong>. If the entity is a $vector$, that is, a vector is attached at every point in space, we have a <strong>vector field</strong>. The concept of a field is so powerful that the whole of modern physics is based on this concept.\n",
    "<br clear=\"left\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we treat the Sun as if it were a particle of mass $m_2$. (This turns out to be a very good approximation!)\n",
    "Instead of assuming that the Sun exerts a force on the Earth across empty space, we assume that the Sun creates a **gravitational field** around (and within) the Sun. It is the Sun's gravitational field at the location of particle 1 that generates the gravitational force on particle 1. (Newton would have been delighted with the concept of a field because he didn't care much for his own idea of <em>action at a distance</em>!)\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is important to note that particle 1 also creates a gravitational field that extends all the way to the Sun and beyond. Suppose that you are particle 1. Then you create a gravitational field, albeit one much, much, weaker than the Sun's, throughout space. \n",
    "Therefore, in accordance with **Newton's 3rd law**, you (particle 1) exert a force on the Sun that is generated by your gravitational field at the location of the Sun. That force is of exactly the same magnitude, namely $f_g$, but acts in exactly the opposite direction to the force the Sun's field, at your location, exerts on you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gravitational field is a vector field; that is, the field is described by attaching a vector $\\vec{g}$ at every point in space. If your mass is $m_1$, then the Sun's gravitational field at your location generates a force on you given by\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "     \\vec{f}_g & = m_1 \\vec{g}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Since $\\vec{f}_g$ is a force, and **Newton's 2nd law** is $\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a}$, it follows that the units of the gravitational field $\\vec{g}$ are those of acceleration, namely, $\\text{m} / \\text{s}^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sun's field at your location points **towards** the source of the field, which is the Sun. Likewise, the Earth creates a gravitational field that extends in all directions throughout space. The Earth's gravitational field at your location points towards the center of the Earth.  The total gravitational field at your location is simply the $vector$ $sum$ of the gravitational fields of everything that has mass!\n",

    "### Projectile Motion\n",
    "In **Exercise 3**, you will study a projectile (a tennis ball) subject to two forces: 1) the force of gravity and 2) a friction force.\n",

    "## Bouncing off a wall\n",
    "When a particle bounces off a smooth wall, it behaves in the same way as a ray of light that bounces off a mirror: the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. \n",
    "<img src=\"bouncing.png\" align=\"left\" alt=\"bouncing off a wall\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "The figure to the left shows the velocity, $\\vec{v}$, of a particle as an arrow that touches a wall at the point $O$ where the particle is expected to strike the wall. The vector $\\vec{u}$ is the velocity of the particle immediately after it bounces off the wall. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key assumption is that the *magnitude* of $\\vec{u}$ immediately after the particle leaves point $O$ is the *same* as that of $\\vec{v}$ immediately before impact. Consequently, $v = OC = u$, $AB = BC$, and the line segment from $A$  to $C$ is perpendicular to the wall and, therefore, in the same direction as the unit vector $\\hat{n}$, which defines the wall's orientation.\n",
    "<br clear=\"left\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the vector from $C$ to $O$ is the same as the vector $\\vec{u}$. Therefore, the vector from $C$ to $A$ plus the vector from $A$ to $O$ is equal the vector $\\vec{u}$,\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "        & = \\vec{v} + \\vec{CA}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Therefore, to complete the formula for $\\vec{u}$ we need to find the vector $\\vec{CA}$. The first point to note is that the length of $\\vec{CA}$ is twice the length of the line segment $AB$. If one moves the unit vector $\\hat{n}$ so that its tail is anchored at point $A$ then $AB = \\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{n}$, which is just $v \\cos\\theta$. Therefore, the magnitude of $\\vec{CA}$ is $2 \\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{n}$. Finally, $\\vec{CA}$ points in the direction $-\\hat{n}$. Consequently, $\\vec{CA} = - (2 \\vec{v}\\cdot\\hat{n}) \\hat{n}$ and we find,\n",

    "where $\\vec{r}$ is the position vector of any point on the line, $\\vec{c}$ is a fixed point on the line, the unit vector $\\hat{u}$ gives the direction of the line, and $t$ is the coordinate (positive or negative) along the line relative to $\\vec{c}$. \n",
